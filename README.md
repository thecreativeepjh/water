    <h1><u>Water pollution:</u></h1>
    <h2><u>Mercury acumulation from the food chain</u>:</h2>
    <p>Paper mill/gold mine polute water with (water soluable)mercury--> microbes absorbe it and make it methylmercury-->Fish eat it-->Some becomes oil soluable due to natural procces-->Mercury stayes stored in fat-->Bigger fish eat the fish-->The mercury stored in fat from smaller fish and some from bigger fish combine-->This continues on until eaten by humans</p>
    <h3>Who, Where, When, Why, How:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Who: the componies runing gold mines and paper mills</li>
        <li>Where: ...</li>
        <li>When: about befor the 1960s</li>
        <li>Why: because they did not know the effects</li>
        <li>How: people would mine for gold then to purify it by mixing it with mercury, then they would burn off the mercury leaving it in the air to come down with rain polluting the river.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Effects:</h3>
    <p>Bioaccumulation refers to the build-up of a pollutant within the body of an organism over time. Bioconcentration (or biomagnification) refers to how mercury concentrations increase going up the food chain, becoming concentrated in higher-level predators such as fish, birds, minks, and otters. Mercury levels increase by 100-1,000 times or more through bioconcentration. For this reason, even relatively low concentrations of mercury in water can contaminate an entire food chain and make fish unsafe for human consumption.</p>
    <h4>Effects for Humans:</h4>
    <p>Having mercury in your system is bad, it is poisonous. Some effects of that are:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Loss of peripheral vision</li>
        <li>"Pins and needles" feelings, usually in the hands, feet, and around the mouth</li>
        <li>Lack of coordination of movements</li>
        <li>Impairment of speech, hearing, walking</li>
        <li>Muscle weakness</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Effects on the Enviroment:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>.</li>
        <li>.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>How to reduce/eliminate effects:?????????</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Congulation filtration</li>
        <li>Activated carbon</li>
        <li>Inverse osmosis</li>
    </ol>
    <p>More info will go here in the future...</p>
